<h2> Database Tables: </h2>
<p>
  These Links provide access to the database tables. You can add, change and delete entries, so I 
  recommend using these pages for database content-administration. If you want to add new databases
  you will have to add them via rails. After adding those new tables please add the link to the 
  file "app/views/db/index.html.erb".
</p>
<pre>
    <a href="/customers">Customers</a>
    <a href="/ingredients">Ingredients</a>
    <a href="/recipes">Recipes</a>
    <a href="/units">Units</a>
</pre>
<p>
  We can use those views as base for users add, modify, delete and view functionalities, although
  those are special views of the db.
